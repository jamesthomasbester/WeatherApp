i've utilized chart.js for the charting of the next 24hr weather and all infomation comes from openweatherapi,

mobile responsiveness added via css (css is not my strong suit i have found)

if you see below the layout is altered to mobile viewports.
after user feedback, i now redirect user to the current weather section after a query

no assets needed, the website should work right after a clone,
occasionly having an issue with the api key not being accepted.
